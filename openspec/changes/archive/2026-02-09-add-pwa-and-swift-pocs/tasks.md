## 1. PWA Proof-of-Concept
- [x] 1.1 Scaffold Next.js app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- [x] 1.2 Integrate Tiptap editor with basic formatting (bold, italic, headings, checklists, code blocks)
- [x] 1.3 Persist note content to localStorage (single note is fine for PoC)
- [x] 1.4 Add PWA manifest and service worker for installability and offline support
- [x] 1.5 Verify PWA installs on desktop Chrome and iOS Safari (Add to Home Screen)

## 2. Swift Shell Proof-of-Concept
- [x] 2.1 Create minimal Swift/AppKit project (no Xcode project — use `swift build` or single-file compile)
- [x] 2.2 Implement floating `NSPanel` with `WKWebView` loading the PWA URL
- [x] 2.3 Add global hotkey (`⌥ N`) to toggle panel visibility
- [x] 2.4 Verify the editor works correctly inside `WKWebView` (keyboard input, formatting, scrolling)
